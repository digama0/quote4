# Expression quotations for Lean 4

This package combines the
intuitiveness of modal sequent calculus
with the power and speed of
Lean 4's metaprogramming facilities.
It introduces the `Q(·)` modality:
`Q(α)` denotes an expression of type `α`.
The type former comes with the following
natural introduction rule:

```
$a :   α,  $b :   β,  $c :   γ  ⊢   t  : Type
---------------------------------------------
 a : Q(α),  b : Q(β),  c : Q(γ) ⊢ Q(t) : Type
```

The lower-case `q(·)` macro serves
as the modal inference rule,
allowing us to construct values in `Q(·)`:
```
$a :   α,  $b :   β,  $c :   γ  ⊢   t  :   δ
---------------------------------------------
 a : Q(α),  b : Q(β),  c : Q(γ) ⊢ q(t) : Q(δ)
```

## Example

Let us write a type-safe version of `mkApp`:

```lean
import Qq
open Qq

set_option trace.compiler.ir.result true in

def betterApp {α : Q(Sort u)} {β : Q($α → Sort v)}
  (f : Q((a : α) → $β a)) (a : Q($α)) : Q($β $a) :=
q($f $a)

#eval betterApp q(Int.toNat) q(42)
```

There are many things going on here:
1. The `betterApp` function compiles to a single `mkApp` call.
1. It does not require the `MetaM` monad.
1. Implicit arguments (such as `α` or `u`) get filled in by type inference.
1. The second argument, `q(42)`,
   correctly constructs an expression of type `Int`.

Because `betterApp`
takes `α` and `u` (and `β` and `v`) as arguments,
it can also perform more interesting tasks:
for example,
we can change `q(f a)` into `q(id f a)`
without changing the interface
(even though the resulting expression
now contains both the type and the universe level).

The arguments do not need to refer
to concrete types like `Int` either:
`List ((u : Level) × (α : Q(Sort u)) × List Q(Option $α))`
does what you think it does!

In fact it is a crucial feature
that we can write metaprograms
transforming terms of nonconcrete types
in inconsistent contexts:
```lean
def tryProve (n : Q(Nat)) (i : Q(Fin $n)) : Option Q($i > 0) := ...
```
If the `i > 0` in the return type were a concrete type in the metalanguage,
then we could not call `tryProve` with `n := 0`
(because we would need to provide a value for `i : Fin 0`).
Furthermore,
if `n` were a concrete value,
then we could not call `tryProve` on
the subterm `t` of `fun n : Nat => t`.

## Implementation

The type family on which this package is built is called `QQ`:

```lean
def QQ (α : Expr) := Expr
```

The intended meaning of `e : QQ t` is that
`e` is an expression of type `t`.
Or if you will,
`isDefEq (← inferType e) t`.
(This invariant is not enforced though,
but it can be checked with `QQ.check`.)
The `QQ` type is not meant to be used manually.
You should only interact with it
using the `Q(·)` and `q(·)` macros.

## Comparison

Template Haskell provides a similar mechanism
for type-safe quotations,
writing `Q Int` for an expression of type `Int`.
This is subtly different
to the `QQ` type family considered here:
in Lean notation,
TH's family has the type `Q : Type u → Type`,
while ours has the type `QQ : Expr → Type`.
In Lean, `Q` is not sufficiently expressive
due to universe polymorphism:
we might only know at runtime which universe the type is in,
but `Q` version fixes the universe at compile time.
Another lack of expressivity concerns dependent types:
a telescope such as `{α : Q Type} (a : Q α)` is not well-typed
with TH's `Q` constructor,
because `α` is not a type.

## To do

- This has almost certainly been done before
  somewhere else, by somebody else.

- `ql(imax u (v+1))`

- Automatically create free variables for recursion.
  Maybe something like this:
```lean
def turnExistsIntoForall : Q(Prop) → MetaM Q(Prop)
  | ~q(∃ x, p x) => do
     q(∀ x, $(x => turnExistsIntoForall q($p $x)))
  | e => e
```

- Matching should provide control over type-class diamonds, such as
```lean
~q((a + b : α) where
  Semiring α
  commutes ∀ n, OfNat α n
  a + a defEq 0)
```

- Auto-bound implicit types
  send Lean into an infinite loop
  (not universes though).

- Other bug fixes, documentation, and assorted polishing.
